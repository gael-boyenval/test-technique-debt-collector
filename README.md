## introduction

we are going to build a simple CLI tool together. 
Do not stress out, it's a pair programming experience, so you don't need to know anything appart from basic nodejs, git and react knowledge. 
You can and should absolutly use the web, and any documentation you need to complete thoses tasks, and ask ANY question to me. I mean ANY QUESTION. Not knowing something is perfectly fine, whatever it is. However, not asking for help or informations when you do need it will be considered counter productive, and will not give you good points.

**I'm interested in your thought process and your ability to work with me**


### 1 - install and setup

- clone this repo
- create a new branch with your name as branch name
- install https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink
- create ink app with typescript
- you probably need to re-organise the files and directory, in order to preserve the readme file, but to have the CLI in the root directory of this repo.

### 2 - build a CLI

- create a CLI that take a string as an argument. 
- the cli then load and read the `./example.tsx` file as a string and should count the number of occurences of the string passed as an argument within the file and print: `{string} found {x} time(s) within the file`


### 3 - Make a pull request
- commit each meaningfull steps of your test using conventional commit standard
- push your branch and make a pull request
